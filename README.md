# Floating Around

**Floating Around** is a game created as a school project by **Karim Debbabi** and **[Michinex](https://github.com/michinex0805)**.  

## About the Game
This game features exploration, crafting, and survival mechanics. Most of the in-game assets (backgrounds, sounds, and inventory images) were created by me, while the main screen and character graphics were contributed by Michinex.

There are a few bugs in the **loading and saving system** due to time constraints during development. We are aware of these and plan to improve them in future updates.
